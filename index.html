          <p style="text-align:justify">In 1991 Emma Sian Hebron (known to most as Sian), was a fresh medical school graduate and had her first job working in the pediatrics department in Taunton, Somerset, England. The hours were long and the weather was dreary; so when her Australian registrar gave her the opportunity to work at his hospital — Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick, Australia, Sian jumped at the opportunity and didn’t think twice.
            <br>
            <br>
            After six long months of waiting to hear from Australia’s Visa Department, Sian was finally off to the land down under. The Australian Government had permitted her a two year work visa, as long as she stayed working at the Children’s Hospital in Sydney.
            <br>
            <br>
            So on a cold British November evening in 1992, Sian took her parents Michael and Sylvia Hebron to the poshest restaurant in Exeter and bid them farewell for what they all thought would be only two years.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a tedious first leg of her 38 hour long journey, Sian stepped off the plane at Singapore already having made a new friend in her in-flight neighbour — a British/Australian, Stephen Conyers-East. Little did she know, under a year later Stephen would become her husband.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6"><p style="text-align:justify">After only two months of what was meant to be two years escaping England’s miserable weather and tediously long shifts, Sian and Stephen were engaged and wanting to settle down in Stephen’s home town, Noosa, Queensland.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately this decision didn’t sit well with the Australian Government. Once they found out she had quit her job in Sydney and flew to Queensland where she began applying to work as a general practitioner, she was threatened with deportation.
            <br>
            <br>
            In early 1993 after their engagement, the happy-in-love couple had an interview at Australia House where it came down to one woman believing they were truly in love, and Sian was allowed to stay in Australia on her temporary residency visa. Once Stephen and Sian were married in September 1993, they had to prove they had been living together for a year, then she was allowed to apply for permanent residency. After two years with permanent residency Sian would be allowed to apply for Australian citizenship.

              <p style="text-align:justify">This was a tedious, stressful and emotional time for the couple. Sian was luckily allowed to work in Nambour Hospital; and whilst the work was plentiful, it was not what Sian had wanted to do long-term with her degree. However, she was told if she wanted to leave the Australian hospital system she had to requalify as a doctor in Australia and take the Australian Medical Council Exam. She was required to fly to Sydney and complete what was essentially her final medical exams all over again.
              <br>
              <br>
              Unfortunately, the trouble did not stop there. Once Sian had acquired her permanent residency and passed the exam, she was only allowed to work as a non-vocational general practitioner and earned significantly less due to her overseas medical training. Even when she acquired her Australian Citizenship in May 1997, she was still ‘not qualified’. From 1994-2000 Sian worked at a sub-standard pay level until she was allowed to take the Royal College exam for General Practitioners.

         <p style="text-align:justify">It took Sian eight years to become regarded as a qualified doctor in Australia. From the moment she landed in Sydney in November 1992 to the year she gained full recognition as a doctor in 2000; Sian had gotten engaged, received temporary and permanent visas, married Stephen, received citizenship, and started a family with two baby girls. Eight years later Sian start her own medical practice in Noosa and become a successful business owner and general practitioner.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">A visit from Sian in 1997, with a one-year-old in tow and another ‘in the oven’, was all it took for Michael and Sylvia Hebron to pack up and leave their beloved England for Australia’s shores.
          <br>
          <br>
          Michael and Sylvia had lived their whole lives in the United Kingdom. They had owned pubs in London and Exeter and had raised two children. With their eldest Kevin already in Australia and Sian now following suit, they didn’t want to miss out on watching their children and grandchildren grow up.
          <br>
          <br>
          After they made the decision in 1997, it took Sylvia and Michael four years to eventually get to Australia.  A fraudulent private agency ran off with five-thousand pounds of their money after doing up their visa documents. Luckily, before they disappeared with the money, Michael asked for copies of the documents and they were able to take them to Australia House.
          <br>
          <br>
          After five trips to Australia House in London and a whole lot of back and forth, Sylvia and Michael finally got their letter saying they were welcome to Australia as permanent residents under a Balance of Family and Aged Parents Visa.
          <br>
          <br>
          They had to be in Australia by a certain date, and that date was fourth months from the time they receieved the letter. They had to sell their home in Exeter, pack up their home into shipping containers and organise their pensions (which were frozen once they left the country).

 Sylvia remembers what a stressful time this was for them, saying goodbye to family and friends and the country they had called home for the past 60+ years. However, the reason for their move kept them going no matter how stressful and tedious the four years were.
 <br>
 <br>
 The move Sian's parents made to be near her and her children has always played a major part in her life. She stated; “How amazing, strong and determined they were to come out here. There were times I wanted to move interstate, but how could I move away from my parents and take their grandchildren away after all they have done to come be near us”.

   <p style="text-align:justify">Sylvia and Michael engulfed themselves in Australian life from the get go. Michael joined the Freemasons, the local bowls club and RSL. Whilst Sylvia involved herself in groups like the local radio, the University of the Third Age, book club and the list goes on. They also became the most devoted and loving grandparents to their grandchildren. Helping Sian and Stephen with the school trips, after-school sport activities, and becoming fully immersed in their families lives.
   <br>
   <br>
   Sylvia does not regret her decision to move one bit. She recounts; “from the moment I got off the plane in Queensland and my three-year-old granddaughter who I had never met before, Portia, held my hand, it felt like I was already part of the family”.
